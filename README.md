# End_of_outbreak_app
Shiny app that generates and displays end of outbreak probabilities for infectious disease outbreaks.  

The app comes pre-loaded with data relating to a small (8 case) outbreak of Ebola in the Likati region of DRC in 2017 (Likiti_outbreak.csv) 

Users are also able to upload their own outbreak data and serial interval data to the app in the form of csv files.  

End of outbreak probabilities can also be downloaded from the app as csv files.
