# End of outbreak app
Shiny app that generates and displays end of outbreak probabilities for infectious disease outbreaks.

Download the folder named App to be able to run the app on your own machine using R.   

App.r contains all the code to run the app.

Required R libraries: ggplot2, plotly, shiny, shinycssloaders, shinyvalidate.

The app requires a csv file (Likiti_outbreak.csv) that contains data relating to a 8 case outbreak of Ebola in the Likati region of DRC in 2017. 

Users are able to upload their own outbreak data and serial interval data to the app in the form of csv files.  

End of outbreak probabilities can also be downloaded from the app as csv files.
